\section{Known Errors and Issues}
\subsection{No more config/xbeeconfig.rb}\smalltodo[noline]{Find replacement solution for xbeeconfig.rb}
The config/xbeeconfig.rb was removed by Mike Ashmore and for good reason. The config had needed configuration detailing where and how to read the XBee module, but it wasn't the best solution especially as it ruined a good way to Gemify the Ruby::XBee code.

\noindent The commit code reads: \textit{"Removed conf/xbeeconfig.rb - it's not a good way to do this. Of cours… …e now I need to figure out what \textbf{is} a good way to do this.} However, seems there was no good solution as currently the values are hardcoded to \textbf{bin/ruby-xbee.rb}.

\subsection{Better exception handling}
\smalltodo[noline]{Implement critical exception handling for proper functioning}
Currently ruby-xbee is very easily choked. Needs to be fixed.

\section{What I'm in the progress of doing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Removed reset when starting api mode, the api mode start should be optional and should it be part of UART?
\end{itemize}
