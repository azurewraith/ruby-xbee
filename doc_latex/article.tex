\begin{abstract}
You stumbled upon something and are figuring where are you and what is this? WHAT IS THIS!?! As I started to play with Ruby-Xbee and decided to make it work for myself I thought that sooner or later someone might stumble upon it and also dig into the documentation. Well, this is \textbf{not} it. The main Ruby-Xbee gem is documented using RDoc\cite{rdoc} and compiled version is also included in the source code. However, I felt that although RDoc is good for documenting the source itself it's not that good for keeping up with other stuff that happens in the background and which can potentially be equally important in the long run. This article is a compilation of random things and is not meant to be read. But it can potentially be a source of good knowledge - who knows, you might even benefit reading some of this. If you are asking in your mind, why the hell \LaTeX ? Why not? Perhaps I'm up to drawing something...
